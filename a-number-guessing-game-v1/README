This program runs a fun game that encourages a user to beat their high score.

The aim of the game:
-- To guess the number the system has chosen at random from 1 to 10.
-- To do this in as few attempts as possible
-- To beat your own high score.

The game only accepts whole numbers from 1 to 10 when making a guess. An error message will be presented and your
attempt will not be counted if the wrong informaiton is entered.

At the end of each game, you can choose to play again (Y or N)
